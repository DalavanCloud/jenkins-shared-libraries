# CFPB Jenkins pipeline shared libraries

TODO description tk

TODO add some background, referring back to https://github.com/cfpb/jenkins-automation/blob/master/src/main/groovy/jenkins/automation/utils/CommonUtils.groovy#L64

TODO maybe because we no longer have the `triggers`, 'fixed' emails no
longer have 'Fixed' in the subject line, but instead say 'Building'. It would
be nice if we could figure out why this is, and then get the 'Fixed' label
back in the subject line. Note however that emails about failing builds do
still say 'Failure' and 'Still Failing' in the subject.
